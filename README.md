# Dungeon of Doom

This is a learning project, created so I can get a feel for functional programming in general and Elm in particular. As a side learning project it should be noted this program may never be finished or even work.

Dungeon of Doom is an Elm reimplementation of an old game written in basic for Microcomputers from the 80's. The game was published in the book ["Write your own fantasy games for your Microcomputer"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTel93SThEYkJkZHc/view) published by [Usborne](https://usborne.com/browse-books/features/computer-and-coding-books/) in 1984 (ISBN 0-86020-835-4)

The in progress version is hosted on github pages here [https://snoozing101.github.io/DoD/](https://snoozing101.github.io/DoD/)

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

To build to push to github pages I use

```
PUBLIC_URL=./ elm-app build
```

The build is then pushed online with

```
gh-pages
```
